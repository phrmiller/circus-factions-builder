# Design Notes

Remember the "YAGNI" (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle. You've fallen into that trap so many times. Start very, very simple.

I don't want to feel like every post needs an image.

The post "description" will serve as both the meta tag description and the text used when showing a preview of a post, such as on the home page.

Avoid any situation where the same basic fact must be manually maintained in multiple places. For example, if you're going to put the latest publish date in the file name, don't also make this a separately editable field in the YAML metadata.

Home page characteristics:
    - Start simple. Displays summaries for each long post. In order. No limit.
